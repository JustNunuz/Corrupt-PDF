# PDF Corruption with Broken Cross-Reference (XRef) Table

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a simple PDF file and intentionally corrupt its cross-reference (xref) table. The corrupted PDF file is intended to simulate a broken structure that results in errors when opened with PDF viewers.

## What the Code Does

1. **PDF Creation**: 
   - The script generates a basic, valid PDF file using the `ReportLab` library. 
   - The file contains simple text: "This is a test PDF file" and "This file will have a broken cross-reference table."
   
2. **Corrupting the PDF**:
   - After creating the valid PDF, the script reads the file and appends a broken xref table.
   - The corrupted xref table contains invalid object references, an incorrect `startxref`, and points to non-existent objects in the trailer section of the PDF.

   This corruption simulates a malformed PDF that is no longer properly structured, and the file becomes unreadable.

3. **Corrupted PDF**:
   - The final corrupted PDF is saved as `broken_xref.pdf`, which is the result of appending the corrupted xref table.

## What Happens When You Open the Corrupted PDF

When you attempt to open the corrupted PDF file (`broken_xref.pdf`) in a PDF viewer, the following errors or issues will likely occur:

- **Invalid xref table**: The PDF viewer will be unable to properly read the xref table due to broken or invalid object references.
- **Unexpected end of file**: The corruption in the xref table can lead to an "Unexpected end of file" error, as the viewer cannot locate the necessary objects in the file.
- **Cannot find object referenced in xref**: The PDF reader may display an error saying it cannot find the object referenced by the xref table due to the non-existent object offsets.
  
As a result, the PDF viewer will fail to render the document, and you may see an error message similar to the following:
- "Invalid cross-reference table."
- "Unable to load document."
- "Unexpected end of file."

The file will appear as corrupted and unusable, highlighting how tampering with the xref table renders a PDF file unreadable.
