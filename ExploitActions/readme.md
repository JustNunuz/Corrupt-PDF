## PDF Actions

PDF files support a variety of actions, enabling functionalities such as opening links, submitting text in forms, and more. These actions are controlled through an attribute called `Actions`, which specifies behaviors triggered by certain events (like opening a document, clicking a link, or closing the file).

This folder explores various types of PDF actions and demonstrates how they can be manipulated or exploited. Below is an overview of the primary types of actions available in the PDF specification.

### 1. **Trigger Events**

Actions in PDFs can be triggered by different events, allowing dynamic responses to user interactions. Common trigger events include:

- **Document Open**: Executes an action when the document is opened.
- **Page Open/Close**: Executes an action when a specific page is opened or closed.
- **Mouse Events**: Triggers on clicks or when a cursor enters/exits a button area.
- **Form Field Events**: Triggers when a form field is selected, modified, or submitted.

### 2. **Action Types**

PDF actions support a wide range of operations, such as file navigation, URL launching, JavaScript execution, and more. Here are some common types:

- **GoTo Action**: Navigates to a specific page within the PDF.
- **GoToR Action**: Jumps to a specific page or location in an external PDF file.
- **GoToE Action**: Navigates to a location within an embedded file.
- **Launch Action**: Launches an external application or opens a file (e.g., PDF, image, or executable).
- **URI Action**: Opens a URL, launching a browser to the specified address.
- **JavaScript Action**: Runs embedded JavaScript, useful for form validation, custom interactions, or effects.
- **Named Action**: Executes common navigation commands, such as:
  - **NextPage**: Advances to the next page.
  - **PrevPage**: Returns to the previous page.
  - **FirstPage**: Jumps to the first page.
  - **LastPage**: Moves to the last page.
- **SubmitForm Action**: Sends form data to a specified URL.
- **ResetForm Action**: Resets form fields to default values.
- **Hide Action**: Shows or hides specific form fields.
- **Sound Action**: Plays an audio file.
- **Movie Action**: Plays an embedded video.
- **Rendition Action**: Controls playback of multimedia elements, often with advanced settings.
- **Thread Action**: Enables navigation through linked "article threads."
- **Trans Action**: Adds transition effects (e.g., dissolve, wipe) between pages.

### 3. **Chained Actions**

PDF actions can also be chained, meaning a single event (like opening a document) can trigger multiple actions in sequence, providing more complex interaction options.

### Security Considerations

PDF actions, especially those involving JavaScript or launching external files, can introduce security risks. Many PDF viewers restrict or warn users about such actions, particularly those related to JavaScript and file execution. **Therefore, these examples may not always work.**

While PDF actions enable enhanced interactivity, navigation, and multimedia experiences, they can also create vulnerabilities if not carefully managed. This folder aims to demonstrate these actions responsibly, showing both their potential and their risks.
