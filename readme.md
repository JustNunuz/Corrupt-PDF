## Presentation for PyCon Zim 2024

This project is a Python-based demonstration of techniques to intentionally corrupt PDF files. It explores the potential vulnerabilities and security risks in handling and manipulating PDF documents, emphasizing issues related to data integrity and document security.

## Disclaimer

This repository is intended for educational and research purposes only. It explores techniques for manipulating PDFs, identifying potential vulnerabilities, and demonstrating how these can be achieved using Python. The goal is to reveal and understand how PDF files can be altered or corrupted, with a particular focus on testing PDF viewers' handling of embedded JavaScript and other manipulations.

This is not an endorsement or encouragement for malicious use. The techniques demonstrated here should never be used on files intended for distribution or in any way that could harm or disrupt systems, users, or data. Unauthorized use of these methods outside of a controlled, research-focused environment is strictly discouraged and may be illegal.

By using this repository, you agree to take full responsibility for any actions you take based on this information. Always use these techniques responsibly and within the bounds of applicable laws and ethical guidelines.
